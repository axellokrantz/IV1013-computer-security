# IV1013-computer-security
## Course contents
* Basic cryptography: symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.
* Cryptographic hashing and digital signatures.
* Security in protocols and services of the Internet.
* Certificates and infrastructures for open key encryption.
* Security in network systems: routers, firewalls, and systems to detect intrusion.
* Security in operating systems.
* Software security: vulnerability, attacks, and defence mechanisms.

## Intended learning outcomes

After passing the course, students should be able to:

* Explain basic mechanisms in, and the structure of, secure communications protocols
* Describe weaknesses in computer systems, software, networks, and communications protocols as well as explain attacks that utilise such weaknesses.
* Explain and compare advantages and disadvantages with common cryptographic technologies.
* Design and implement simple cryptographic applications.
* Account for and recognise threats against information security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. as well as choose appropriate methods to protect against threats
* Design, implement, and evaluate security in networks.
